Genetic algorithm with a giffler thompson algorithm for FJSSP

Hello, my name is Henrik. I am an mechanical engineer who enjoys to code in his freetime. This my approch for the FJSSP.

PLEASE NOTE: 
- this is my first programming project (please have mercy with me :D)
- i am not a trained programmer (like i said, i am an mechanical engineer)
- my native language is german, sadly there are still commits, comments and variablenames in german. Sorry, i will replace them ASAP
- i used this first project to get in touch with programming and learning java (which i really enjoyed)
- i would love every kind of feedback

Thank you


Some notes to the programm:
- i used a Genetic Algorithm
  - Mutation:
  - Rekombination
  - Selektion:
- i used a list planning algorithm (Giffler-Thompson-Algorithm) to get only permitted schedules
  - for reference: 
  
  
  Some notes to the excel sheet:
  - Every Operation needs a number
  - Programm is made for n Operations and m machines (no limits)
  - predecessors must be given
  - multiple jobs can be given, every operation only need its predecessors
  - if machine cant do an operation just put in a 0
